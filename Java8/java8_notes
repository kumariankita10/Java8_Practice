
1) What are the new features added in Java 8?

Java 8 introduced major functional programming features.
Key additions are Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, Stream API, Default & Static methods in interfaces, Optional class, and new Date-Time API.
These features make code more concise and support parallel processing.

Example: Processing employee salary list using Stream instead of loops.

2) What is a Default method and why we need it?

A default method is a method with body inside an interface.
It allows adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementing classes.

Example:
If an interface Vehicle adds default void start(), old classes don’t need to implement it again.

3) What is a static method in interface and why we need it?

A static method in an interface has a body and belongs to the interface itself.
It is used for utility/helper methods related to the interface.

Example:
InterfaceName.utilityMethod() used without creating objects.

4) Default methods vs Static methods in interfaces
Default Method	Static Method
Called using object	Called using interface name
Can be overridden	Cannot be overridden
Supports backward compatibility	Used for helper utilities
5) What is a Functional Interface?

A functional interface has only one abstract method.
It is used as a target for lambda expressions.

Example:
Runnable, Callable, or Comparator.

6) What is a Lambda expression?

A lambda expression is a short form of anonymous function.
It allows passing behavior as an argument.

Example:
(a,b) -> a + b

7) How to write Lambda expression?

Basic syntax:

(parameters) -> { body }


Example:
name -> System.out.println(name);

8) How to invoke Lambda expressions?

Lambda is assigned to a functional interface and then called.

Example:

Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
r.run();

9) Predefined Functional Interfaces in Java 8

Common ones from java.util.function:

Predicate<T>

Function<T,R>

Consumer<T>

Supplier<T>

10) What is Predicate?

Predicate takes an input and returns true or false.
Used mainly for filtering.

Example:
Predicate<Employee> p = e -> e.salary > 100000;

11) What is Supplier?

Supplier returns a value but takes no input.

Example:
Supplier<String> s = () -> "Welcome User";

12) What is Consumer?

Consumer accepts input but returns nothing.
Used for performing actions.

Example:
Consumer<String> c = msg -> System.out.println(msg);

13) What is Function?

Function takes one input and returns a result.

Example:
Function<Employee, String> f = e -> e.getName();

14) What is Optional class and why we need it?

Optional is a container object used to avoid NullPointerException.
It forces checking value before use.

Example:
Optional<Employee> emp = Optional.ofNullable(findEmp());

15) What is Stream API?

Stream API is used to process collections in functional style.
It supports filtering, mapping, sorting, and parallel processing.

Example:
Filtering high-salary employees.

16) How to create Stream object in Java?
List<Employee> list = ...
Stream<Employee> s = list.stream();


Or directly:
Stream.of(1,2,3,4);

17) How to filter data using Stream API?
list.stream()
    .filter(e -> e.salary > 100000)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

18) What is map() operation in Java 8?

map() transforms one object into another.

Example:
Convert employee list to name list:

list.stream()
    .map(e -> e.getName())

19) What is flatMap() in Java 8?

flatMap() is used to flatten nested collections.

Example:
List of departments → list of all employees.

20) Difference between intermediate and terminal operations
Intermediate	Terminal
Returns Stream	Returns result
Lazy execution	Executes pipeline
Example: filter(), map()	collect(), forEach()
21) Program: Employees with salary > 1 lakh
list.stream()
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 100000)
    .map(e -> e.getName())
    .forEach(System.out::println);

22) Date changes in Java 8

Java 8 introduced new Date-Time API in java.time package.
It is immutable, thread-safe, and easy to use.

Example:
LocalDate.now()

23) What is forEach() method in Java?

forEach() is a terminal operation used to iterate elements.

Example:
list.forEach(System.out::println);

24) New changes in Collection Framework in Java 8

forEach() added

removeIf() added

stream() and parallelStream() added

default methods in Collection interfaces

25) What is Spliterator?

Spliterator is used to split collections for parallel processing.
It helps Stream API to process data faster.
